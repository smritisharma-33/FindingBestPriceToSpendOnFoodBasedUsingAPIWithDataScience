Introduction
The aim of the project is to identify venues in Mumbai, India based on their rating and average
prices. In this notebook, we will identify various venues in the city of Mumbai, India, using Foursquare
API and Zomato API, to help visitors select the restaurants that suit them the best. Whenever a user is
visiting a city they start looking for places to visit during their stay. They primarily look for places based
on the venue ratings across all venues and the average prices such that the locations fits in their budget.
Here, we'll identify places that are fit for various individuals based on the information collected from the
two APIs and Data Science. Once we have the plot with the venues, any company can launch an
application using the same data and suggest users such information.
Data Collection from APIs
To begin with, we will take a look at Mumbai on the Map using the folium library. We will also fetch
the data from two different APIs. Foursquare API: We will use the Foursquare API to fetch venues in
Mumbai starting from the middle upto 4 Kilometers in each direction. Zomato API: The Zomato API
provides information about various venues including the complete address, user ratings, price for two
people, price range and a lot more.
Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements
like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and
understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive
amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.
